                    <h1>Rationale</h1>
                    <p>The resource we have created will serve as an interactive website through which those accessing it will be able to learn about the different public faces of HelthWyzer. However, by using the username Crake they will also be able to look at the website from an administrative point of view, giving them access to different content than the one previously displayed. By doing so, the user will be able to directly understand the influence and power of HelthWyzer in the world, the differences between what they advertise and what they are, and the truth behind their objectives and developments by being able to directly compare both sides of the webpage. With this resource, the user will gain a better understanding of the biggest enterprise of the novel. It is important to look into the enterprises in the novel because many big name companies today make many similar unethical choices as those in the novel do, although they may not be as drastic.</p>
                    <p>The companies in Oryx and Crake, including HelthWyzer, make many unethical and immoral decisions that most people are either not aware of or choose to not regard. After all, asking questions that go against the financial interests of powerful enterprises is an uphill battle at best. In the novel, when people do start asking questions on the ethicality and morality of the companies' actions the CorpsSeCorps (the police system in the novel) will make sure to step in and silence them permanently. As Crake had said in the novel,</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>I bet your dad was in on something like that. Some scam like the HelthWyzer one. I bet she found out.'</p>
                        <p>'Oh, I don't think so,' said Jimmy, 'I think she got involved in some God's Gardeners-type outfit. Some bunch of wackos. Anyway, my dad wouldn't have...'</p>
                        <p>'I bet she knew they were starting to know she knew.'</p>
                        <small><cite title="pg. 213">pg. 213</cite></small>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>During this conversation Crake is trying to understand why Jimmy's mother ran away. Crake thinks that Jimmy's father was in on one of the unethical schemes that were occurring at HelthWyzer, and that when Jimmy's mother found out she struggled with not speaking against it. She then got scared for her life, because she believed the CorpsSeCorps knew that she was finding out information that didn't concern her. From Crake's interpretation of why Jimmy's mother left, we can see that when people in the novel found out what was actually going on in the different companies, they would fear for themselves and even run away to seek refuge.</p>
                    <p>In today's world, companies will also go to great lengths to sell their products and make as much of a profit as they can. Much like the controversial ethical decisions that HelthWyzer takes part in throughout the novel, there was a recent incident with the pharmaceutical company Mylan. Mylan currently has a monopoly on EpiPens and because of this, they decided to raise the price of EpiPens from $100 for a two-pack in 2009 to $608 today. However, can this huge price raise be considered ethical for the life-saving device that many people need? After this incident occurred, Mylan released several statements trying to defend their actions and get some of the pressure off of themselves. This goes to show that companies will do whatever it takes to be profitable and keep people from buying their product, regardless of the consequences that could arise from it.</p>
                    <p>Another article written by the Penn Bioethics Journal also serves to elaborate on the issue of ethics in the pharmaceutical industry. It talks about the case of Turing Pharmaceutical's Daraprim drug, a case much like Mylan's in which the company raised the prices of a life-saving drug just because they held the monopoly over it. This article, however, attempts to explain the controversy that arises from this. "The role of capitalism is a driving force in this debate, as many believe that the sole responsibility of business is to maximize profit... this role is challenged from an ethical perspective that demands that the universal right to life be considered... The more definitive the cure, the closer we are to asking, "What's the value of a human life?"" (Penn 2015). The debate being explained is the very same one that takes place both in real life and in the novel, with companies being torn between the two and ultimately choosing profit over the betterment of society, showing that health has a dark side called greed.</p>
                    <p>In the novel, not only do companies execute people that could be potential threats to these companies, but they keep the customers and buyers in the dark by not telling them all of the side effect a product could have, or if the product will actually work. One example of this can be seen when Crake explains his father's death, saying that he was executed for attempting to whistle-blow on the fact that HelthWyzer was getting their patients sick for profit. We can also see this when Crake is creating his "BlyssPluss Pill". He tells Jimmy that "These three capabilities would be the selling points, but there would be a fourth, which would not be advertised. The BlyssPluss Pill would also act as a sure-fire one-time-does-it-all birth-control pill, for males and female alike." Crake is actively creating a pill to sell to people without letting the people buying and using it know what all of its capabilities and functions are. It's not ethical to avoid telling people what all of the side effects are of a pill they are taking are, regardless of the personal mission you may want to achieve for your company or for yourself. Although this does not happen as drastically in the real world, there are many companies that still do not explicitly state all of the side effects that a product could have. Pharmaceuticals have a moral duty to inform their patients of what it is they are putting into their bodies, follow through on their promises, and seek general welfare for society. Anything other than this is an abuse of their label and proof that they do not deserve the power they hold.</p>
